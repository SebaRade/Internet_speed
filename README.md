# Internet speed

2022-01-02

Since December 2021 customers are allowed to claim reduction of internet costs if

- 90% of the maximum speed is not reached at least once in two days or
- the average speed is not reached in 90% of the measurements or
- the minimum speed is undercut on at least two days.

Our contractually guaranteed min/avg/max speeds were 6.0/9.8/16.0 Mbit/s in the download and 0.7/1.0/2.4 Mbit/s in the upload, respectively. Using our Raspberry Pi, we tested our internet speed half-hourly on 24 consecutive days. This script was used to analyse the generated data revealing that we could claim compensation of costs.
